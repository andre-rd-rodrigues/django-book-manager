# ðŸ“š **Book Manager**

## **Overview**

Book Manager is a web application designed to help users manage their personal book collections, track their reading lists, and write reviews. It enables users to browse books, authors, and genres, while also providing a user-friendly platform to manage their reading habits. The app is built using Django for the backend and integrates a responsive front-end to ensure a seamless user experience.

## **Distinctiveness and Complexity**

### **Distinctiveness**

Book Manager is distinct from other projects in CS50's Web Programming course because:

1. It is not an e-commerce platform or a social network.
2. It focuses on personal book management, including features like creating a reading list, adding and editing books and authors, browsing books by genres or authors, and managing book reviews.
3. The application supports dynamic, real-time updates using Django models and templates for seamless user interaction.
4. It utilizes Docker containerization for simplified deployment and testing.

### **Complexity**

Book Manager satisfies the complexity requirement by:

1. Utilizing Djangoâ€™s relational database to model relationships between books, authors, users, likes, and reviews.
2. Incorporating user authentication and permissions to manage personalized reading lists.
3. Leveraging responsive design principles to create a mobile-friendly interface.
4. Implementing comprehensive filtering and ordering systems:
   - Books can be ordered by title, author, date added, and likes count
   - Reading lists include additional filtering by book reading status
   - Authors can be filtered by search and ordered by name and creation date
   - All listings support ascending/descending order direction
