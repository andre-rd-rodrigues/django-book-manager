# ðŸ“š **Book Manager**

## **Overview**

Book Manager is a CRUD web application designed to help users manage their personal book collections, track their reading lists, and write reviews. It enables users to browse books, authors, and genres, while also providing a user-friendly platform to manage their reading habits. The app is built using Django for the backend and integrates a responsive front-end to ensure a seamless user experience.

## **Distinctiveness and Complexity**

### **Distinctiveness**

Book Manager is distinct from other projects in CS50's Web Programming course because:

1. It is not an e-commerce platform or a social network.
2. It focuses on personal book management, including features like creating a reading list, adding and editing books and authors, browsing books by genres or authors, and managing book reviews.
3. The application supports dynamic, real-time updates using Django models and templates for seamless user interaction.
4. It utilizes Docker containerization for simplified deployment and testing.

### **Complexity**

Book Manager satisfies the complexity requirement by:

1. Utilizing Djangoâ€™s relational database to model relationships between books, authors, users, likes, reading list and reviews.
2. Incorporating user authentication and permissions to manage personalized experience.
3. Leveraging responsive design principles to create a mobile-friendly interface.
4. Implementing comprehensive filtering and ordering systems:
   - Books can be ordered by title, genre, author, date added, ratings and likes count;
   - Reading lists include additional filtering by book reading status;
   - Authors can be filtered by search and ordered by name and by creation user;
   - All listings support ascending/descending order direction.
5. Implementing interactive modals using JavaScript and Django integration:
   - Confirmation modals for all deletion operations to prevent accidental deletions
   - Edit and delete review operations are handled through modals for improved user experience
   - Custom JavaScript handlers manage modal interactions and form submissions
